Backtest-ARIMA-Model-Startegy
Backtested trading strategy based on modelling stock returns based on Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model

Install
This project uses backtrader and pmdarima. Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

$ pip install backtrader[plotting]
$ pip install pmdarima
Interpretation
Dive right into functions.py. I have added a lot of interpretations right after the various functions used in comments. This file starts with normal operations that are required to be done and checked when handling time series to understand it. I have used returns from msft stock to plot all the results (in the plots directory).

Operations covered in functions.py -

one_period-multi_period-continuosly_compounded returns
Plotted returns distribution histogram along with normal distribution histogram on same plot
Performed Ljung-Box Test and plotted autocorrelation lags plot
Plotted scatter plot between retruns and 1-day lag return
Performed Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test and plotted rolling mean, deviation and returns to check stationarity
Log-Difference Returns taken to remove trend and increase stationarity of time series
Time series decomposed into residuals, trend and seasonality components and plotted
Autocorrelation(ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation(PACF) plotted to find q and p resp. for the ARIMA model
AR(1, 1, 0), MA(0, 1, 1), ARIMA(1, 1, 1) model fitted to logarithmic difference of returns. RSS values compared for each to find best fit
Backtesting -

First I have written a custom indicator - class ARIMA_ind to generate a positive buying signal whenever the returns predicted by the ARIMA based model on the past window(20 or 30 days) of current time is positive and go short if predicted results are negative.

I have made 2 indicators -

ARIMA(0, 1, 1) with lag_window = 20 days
This one selects the best ARIMA model for the lag period on its own. I have used pmdarima library for this.
The 2 generated plots are in the backtest_plots directory
